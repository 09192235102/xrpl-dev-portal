        blurb: Each `rippled` server keeps a complete copy of the XRP Ledger's current state, which contains all the accounts, transactions, offers, and other data in the network in an optimized tree format. As transactions and offers are proposed, each server incorporates them into its current copy of the ledger, closes it periodically, and (if configured) participates in advancing the globally-validated version. After the network reaches consensus, that ledger version is validated and becomes permanently immutable. Any transactions that were not included in one ledger version become candidates to be included in the next validated version.
