ripple-dev-portal
=================

This Ripple Developer Portal is focused solely on documentation for the [`ripple-rest`](https://github.com/ripple/ripple-rest) API. The developer portal is a static site leveraging a fork of [`flatdoc`](https://github.com/rstacruz/flatdoc).

The documentation is stored in the "API.md" file in the root of the `ripple-dev-portal` repository. Versioning for the documentation will match the tagged release version for `ripple-rest`.

### The ripple-dev-portal is currently hosted at https://dev.ripple.com ###
