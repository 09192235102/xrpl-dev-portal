# Introduction #

The Gateway Services initiative aims to make gateways interoperable, extending the connectivity of the Ripple Network beyond the bounds of the Ripple ledger. The goal is to allow anyone who's connected to Ripple (not just Ripple account holders) to look up another Ripple-connected entity, find a path between them, quote the cost of a payment, and then make that payment, in a way that is consistent, regulation-compliant, and standards-compliant. It defines a series of REST API calls that make it possible for other gateways and Ripple client applications to perform all of these actions.

Gateways that implement these services can easily link with one another, allowing users who have a business relationship with one of them to send and receive money to parties that are connected to other gateways in an automated fashion, while remaining regulation-compliant. Our Gatewayd framework will implement all these services, so gateway operators using Gatewayd don't need to do anything beyond standard configuration, and those with custom gateway software can use Gatewayd as a reference implementation. 

## Components ##

| Service | Description | Based On | Replaces |
| ------- | ----------- | -------- | -------- |
| [host-meta](#host-meta) | Provides useful metadata about a gateway or service provider, and lists all service endpoints provided by the domain | [RFC6415](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6415) | [ripple.txt](https://ripple.com/wiki/Ripple.txt) |
| [webfinger](#webfinger) | Performs reverse lookup of Ripple addresses, and lists service endpoints for interacting with a specified account holder | [RFC7033](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7033) | [Federation Name Lookup](https://ripple.com/wiki/Federation_protocol) |
| [bridge-payments](#bridge-payments) | Plans payments from any Ripple-connected wallet to any other, connecting through gateways as necessary. | [Ripple-REST payments](http://dev.ripple.com/ripple-rest.html#payments) | [Bridge protocol](https://ripple.com/wiki/Services_API) |
| user-account | Provides standard method for registering an account with a Gateway, and provides signed claims about a user's identity  similar to bridge-payment's required claims | [OpenID Connect Claims](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims), [JWT](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-25) | -- |
| wallet-payment | Makes outgoing payments and monitors for incoming payments, and works with hosted wallets. | [Ripple-REST payments](http://dev.ripple.com/ripple-rest.html#payments) | -- |
| wallet-info | Shows information about a wallet, and works with hosted wallets | [Ripple-REST accounts](http://dev.ripple.com/ripple-rest.html#accounts) | -- |
| wallet-balances | Shows information about balances in multiple currencies, and works with hosted wallets. | [Ripple-REST accounts](http://dev.ripple.com/ripple-rest.html#accounts) | -- |

# Gateway Services Identifiers #

Several APIs require you to identify the sender or recipient of a payment. Since several different types of identifiers can be used this way, Gateway Services defines a standard way to create a Universal Resource Identifier (URI) for each type of resource.

All of these resources map to either a Ripple account, an external account, or a human.

The following URI types should be supported:

| Type of Identifier | Example | Where to WebFinger |
|--------------------|---------|--------------------|
| Email address      | acct:bob@ripple.com | Domain from the email |
| Email-style Federation address | acct:bob@fidor.de | Domain from the address
| Ripple Address     | ripple:rBWay8KRdmroZra4DTXi6h5cLtPhs5mH7v | Domain from the Ripple AccountRoot object |
| Ripple Address with Destination Tag | ripple:rBWay8KRdmroZra4DTXi6h5cLtPhs5mH7v?dt=103047 | Domain from the Ripple AccountRoot object |
| Ripple Name        | ripple:bob | Domain from the Ripple AccountRoot object |

<span class='draft-comment'>Legacy addresses (TBD):</span>

| Type of Identifier | Example | Where to WebFinger |
|--------------------|---------|--------------------|
| US Bank number     | | |
| IBAN Number        | | |
| Credit/Debit card  | acct:4811738483484923@visa.com | visa.com |
| Coin address       | | |
| Paypal address     | acct:rome@ripple.com@paypal.com acct:paypal:rome@ripple.com | |
| Google wallet      | | |
| Square cash        | acct:rome@ripple.com@square.com | square.com |


Participating Parties - neither the sender nor receiver, but information lookup for these parties is important for compliance purposes (e.g. clerk at a store receiving or handing out cash). <span class='draft-comment'>(Specified how?)</span>

# Host-Meta #

Host-Meta tells you about things operated by a domain.

[RFC6415](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6415) defines a standardized way to publish metadata, including information about resources controlled by the host, for any domain. In contrast to the original spec, **Ripple uses the JSON version of host-meta exclusively**, and never queries for the XML version. This spec defines several Ripple-centric resources which a host can advertise in a host-meta file, so that other applications can automatically **find** the host's other Gateway services, and **verify** the domain's various Ripple assets. This extends and replaces the functionality of the [ripple.txt](https://wiki.ripple.com/Ripple.txt) spec.

The response to a host-meta request is a document called a JRD (JSON resource descriptor; there is also an XML version called an XRD). You can retrieve a domain's host-meta JRD by making an HTTP GET request to the `/.well-known/host-meta.json` path at the top level of the domain. You can also GET `/.well-known/host-meta` while providing an `Accept: application/json` header. Hosts implementing Gateway Services should support both methods.

Here is an example of an entire host-meta JRD:

__`GET https://latambridgepay.com/.well-known/host-meta.json`__

## Host-Meta Aliases ##

[Aliases are NOT RECOMMENDED](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6415#section-3.1) in host-meta, according to the spec. Consumers of Gateway Services should not rely on any content there.

## Host-Meta Properties ##

```js
    ...

Ripple defines the following properties:

| Property | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| rl:type  | String | What type of Ripple entity this domain is, for example `"gateway"` <span class='draft-comment'>(What are all the valid types?)</span> |
| rl:domain | String | The domain this host-meta document applies to, which should match the one it is being served from. For example, `"coin-gate.com"` |
| rl:accounts | Array of objects | Each member of this array should be an [account definition object](#acct_def_obj) for an issuing account (cold wallet) operated by this host |
| rl:hotwallets | Array of strings | Each member of this array should be either a base-58-encoded Ripple Address or a Ripple Name for a hot wallet operated by the host |

<span class='draft-comment'>(Might Ripple clients also use the standard objects "name" and "description"?)</span>

#### Account Definition Object <a name="acct_def_obj"></a> ####

An account definition object is a JSON object with the following properties:

| Property | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| address | String | Base-58-encoded Ripple address |
| rl:name | String | (Optional) The [Ripple Name](https://ripple.com/dev-blog/introducing-ripple-names/) of this account, omitting the leading tilde (~) |
| rl:currencies | Object | Map of currencies issued from this address, where field names are the currency codes and values are the maximum amount issued, as a string containing a decimal number. |

Example account definition object:

```js
{
    "address": "rLtys1YJHGj8oTpECWSzDv77YRGDWGduUX",
    "rl:currencies": {
        "BTC": "1000000"
    }
}
```

## Host-Meta Links ##

The `links` field contains links to almost anything, where the meaning of the link is programmatically identified by a relation type, typically a URI, in the `rel` field of the link object. Gateways should use links to advertise the other Gateway Services APIs that they offer.

Gateway Services requires the following links in host-meta:

* [Webfinger link](#webfinger_link)
* [Bridge Payments Get Quotes link](#bridge_quotes_link)
* [Bridge Payments Accept Quote link](#bridge_payments_link)
* [Bridge Payments Get Quote Status link](#bridge_payment_status_link)
* <span class='draft-comment'>(Additional services like user-account and wallet-info TBD?)</span>


### Webfinger Link <a name="webfinger_link"></a> ###

            "template": "https://latambridgepay.com/.well-known/webfinger.json?resource={uri}"
        },
    ...
```

Gateway Services requires the use of the [Webfinger protocol](https://code.google.com/p/webfinger/wiki/WebFingerProtocol). The fields of the link are defined as follows:

                }
            }
        },
        ...
```

The fields of the link are defined as follows:

| Field    | Value  |
|----------|--------|
| rel      | `https://gatewayd.org/gateway-services/bridge_payments` |
| <span class='draft-comment'>href</span>     | The URL of your payments API. (No variable parameters in the URL) |
| properties | Object with key-value map of properties for this link. |

#### Properties ####

The following properties should be provided:

| Field    | Value  |
|----------|--------|
| version  | `"1"` for this version of the spec. |
| fields   | Specification of body fields for this method. <span class='draft-comment'>(But only the ones that are customizeable?)</span> |

For Bridge Payment, the `fields` property should include a `sender_claims` object that defines all the sender claims that might be provided as sub-fields to the `sender_claims` object of a payment at the time of submission. Importantly, this includes a definition of which fields are required or optional. Each field should be defined by the following parameters:

| Field    | Value  | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| type     | String ([Sender Claims Types](#sender-claims-type-reference)) | What sort of data should go in this field. |
| required | Boolean | Whether or not this claim is required in order to send a payment. |
| label    | Object | Map of brief labels for this field. Keys should be [two-character ISO-639.1 codes](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php), and values should be human-readable Unicode strings (in the corresponding language) suitable for display in a UI. |
| description | Object | Map of longer descriptions for this field. Keys should be [two-character ISO-639.1 codes](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) <span class='draft-comment'>(or 3 letter codes instead?

# WebFinger #

WebFinger tells you about a person, hopefully including how to send money to that person.

[RFC7033](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7033) defines the WebFinger protocol as a way to discover information about people or other entities on the internet, from a URI that might not be usable as a locator otherwise, such as an account or email address. The response to a WebFinger request is like the response to a Host-Meta request, but relates to a specific user (or resource) instead of to the domain. The response to a WebFinger request is also called a JRD (JSON Resource Descriptor) 

Gateway Services uses WebFinger to identify the possible beneficiaries of a payment. The *aliases* and *links* in the WebFinger response provide information about a user with regards to Ripple, including what accounts represent that user, and what services can be used to send money to the user.

#### Request format: ####

```
GET /.well-known/webfinger.json?resource={uri}
```

Alternate request format:

```
GET /.well-known/webfinger?resource={uri}
Accept: application/json
```

The following parameters must be provided in the URL:

| Field | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| uri   | A valid, URL-encoded [Gateway Services identifier URI]() | The resource to look up. For Gateway Services, should be an account that might send or receive money. |

#### Response Format ####

The response is a JRD, in a similar format to the response to [host-meta](#host-meta). Gateway Services uses specific [Aliases](#webfinger_aliases) and [Links](#webfinger_links) as described.

#### Example request: ####

__`GET https://latambridgepay.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=ripple:bob`__


#### Example response: ####

<span class='draft-comment'>(note: update to reflect the link formatting we settle on for host-meta)</span>

### Webfinger Aliases <a id="webfinger_aliases"></a> ###

The `aliases` field of a WebFinger document can contain various values, including ones that are not related to Ripple. Gateway Services defines three formats for aliases that refer to Ripple addresses:

<span class='draft-comment'>(Same as URIs? Exactly?)</span>

| Alias for   | Format | Example |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| Ripple Name | `ripple:` followed by the user's Ripple Name, without the tilde (~) | ripple:bob |
| Ripple Address | `ripple:` followed by the user's base-58 encoded Ripple address | ripple:rBWay8KRdmroZra4DTXi6h5cLtPhs5mH7v |
| Ripple Address with Destination Tag | `ripple:` followed by the user's base-58 encoded Ripple address, followed by `?dt=` and an integer destination tag. (This is useful when a user only has a hosted wallet.) | ripple:rf1BiGeXwwQoi8Z2ueFYTEXSwuJYfV2Jpn?dt=23459 |

A user can have any number of aliases of any combination of the above types, in addition to non-Ripple aliases, which clients of Gateway Services should ignore.


### Webfinger Links <a id="webfinger_links"></a> ###

The `links` field of a WebFinger document should contain link elements describing where to find the following APIs:

* Bridge Payments: Get Quotes for payments where this person is the beneficiary
* Bridge Payments: Accept Quote for payments where this person is the beneficiary

Both of these should be specified exactly as in the host-meta, with the following exceptions:

* The `{receiver}` field of the Bridge Payments: Get Quotes `template` should be already filled-in with an appropriate URI based on the resource that was WebFingered.
* The `sender_claims` field of the Bridge Payments: Accept Quote `properties` may differ from the ones available in the host-meta, in case the WebFingered user has different required claims. 


# Bridge Payments #

## Get Quotes ##

Get Quotes tells you what your options are for making a payment.

__`GET https://latambridgepay.com/v1/{sender}/bridge_payments/quotes/{receiver}/{amount}`__

This API should accept parameters that are formatted as follows:

| Parameter | Format | Example(s) |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| sender    | A URL-encoded (%-escaped) [Gateway Services Identifier](#gateway-services-identifiers) | acct%3Abob%40ripple.com |
| receiver  | A URL-encoded (%-escaped) [Gateway Services Identifier](#gateway-services-identifiers) | ripple%3AraLiCEoiYDN3aTw2ZnGmEVXWwYXWiAxR7n |
| amount    | Decimal value, and 3-letter currency code <span class='draft-comment'>(Or hex code for say, GBI?)</span> for the currency, concatenated with a `+` | 10.99+USD |


### Get Quotes Response ###

            "sender_claims": []
        }
    ]
}
```

## Accept Quote ##

Bridge Payments lets you tell the gateway which payment you are making, so it can be ready.

```
POST https://latambridgepay.com/v1/bob%40ripple.com/bridge_payments

{
    "gateway_tx_id": "9876",
