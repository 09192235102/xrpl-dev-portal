# Dev Tools
<!--{# TODO: Ensure that the list below follows the order of the left nav. #}-->

Ripple provides a set of developer tools to help you test, explore, and validate XRP Ledger API requests and behavior.

* **[XRP Ledger Lookup Tool](xrp-ledger-rpc-tool.html)**

    Use this JSON-RPC-based debugging tool to print raw information about a XRP Ledger account, transaction, or ledger.

* **[rippled API WebSocket Tool](websocket-api-tool.html)**

    Need to see the rippled API in action ASAP? Use this tool to send sample requests and get responses. No setup required.

* **[Data API v2 Tool](data-api-v2-tool.html)**

    Need to see the Data API v2 in action ASAP? Use this tool to send prepopulated sample requests and get responses. No setup required.

* **[XRP Ledger Test Net Faucet](xrp-test-net-faucet.html)**

    Use the WebSocket and JSON-RPC Test Net endpoints to test software built on the XRP Ledger without using real funds. Generate Test Net credentials and funds for testing purposes. Test Net ledger and balances are reset on a regular basis.

* **[ripple.txt Validator](ripple-txt-validator.html)**

      Use this tool to verify that your `ripple.txt` is syntactically correct and deployed properly.

      **Warning:** The `ripple.txt` file definition has been deprecated. Use an [xrp-ledger.toml file](xrp-ledger-toml.html) instead.

* **[Transaction Sender](tx-sender.html)**

    Test how your code handles various XRP Ledger transactions by sending them over the Test Net to the address of your choice.
